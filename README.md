# 🏦 Decentralized Credit Union Governance

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution for credit unions! This project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to enable transparent, member-driven governance. Members can propose, vote on, and implement loan policies democratically, solving real-world issues like centralized decision-making, lack of transparency in traditional credit unions, and barriers to member participation. By decentralizing governance, it empowers members to shape policies on interest rates, loan terms, eligibility criteria, and more, reducing corruption and increasing trust.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Secure member registration and verification  
🗳️ Proposal and voting system for loan policies  
💰 Governance token for weighted voting based on membership stakes  
📊 Immutable records of policies, votes, and loan decisions  
✅ Automated enforcement of approved policies on loans  
🚀 Integration with on-chain treasury for fund management  
📈 Real-time dashboards for policy tracking (via off-chain apps)  
🛡️ Anti-collusion mechanisms to prevent vote manipulation  
🔄 Upgradable contracts for future enhancements  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project involves 8 smart contracts written in Clarity, working together to create a fully decentralized governance system for credit unions. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **MembershipContract**: Handles member onboarding, KYC-like verification (using blockchain identities), and tracks membership status. Members must stake a minimum amount to join.
2. **GovernanceTokenContract**: Issues and manages ERC-20-like fungible tokens (SIP-010 compliant on Stacks) that represent voting power, distributed based on deposits or contributions.
3. **ProposalContract**: Allows members to submit proposals for new or updated loan policies (e.g., changing interest rates or collateral requirements). Includes proposal fees to prevent spam.
4. **VotingContract**: Manages voting rounds on proposals. Uses token-weighted voting with time-locked periods to ensure fair participation.
5. **PolicyEnforcementContract**: Stores approved policies as immutable data and enforces them automatically (e.g., validating loan applications against current rules).
6. **LoanApplicationContract**: Processes loan requests from members, checks eligibility based on enforced policies, and automates approvals/disapprovals.
7. **TreasuryContract**: Manages the credit union's funds, including deposits, withdrawals, and loan disbursements. Ensures funds are only released per approved policies.
8. **AuditContract**: Provides transparency by logging all governance actions, votes, and financial transactions for public querying and verification.

**For Members (Voters and Borrowers)**  
- Register via the MembershipContract by staking tokens or providing proof of identity.  
- Earn governance tokens through the GovernanceTokenContract based on your deposits.  
- Propose changes to loan policies using the ProposalContract (e.g., "Lower interest rates for eco-friendly loans").  
- Vote on active proposals in the VotingContract—your vote weight depends on your staked tokens.  
- Apply for loans through the LoanApplicationContract, which auto-checks against the PolicyEnforcementContract.  
- Monitor funds and audit logs via the TreasuryContract and AuditContract for full transparency.  

**For Administrators (Initial Setup)**  
- Deploy the contracts and set initial policies.  
- Once live, governance shifts to members—no central control!  

**For Verifiers/Auditors**  
- Query the AuditContract to verify any vote, policy change, or transaction.  
- Use the PolicyEnforcementContract to confirm current rules and their enforcement history.  

Boom! Your credit union is now member-owned and blockchain-secured, with policies evolving through collective decisions. This setup ensures scalability on Stacks, with low fees and Bitcoin-anchored security.
